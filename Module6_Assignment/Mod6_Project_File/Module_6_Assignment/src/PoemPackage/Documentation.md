Assignment:
Module 6 - JavaFX GUI for Module 2 program

Objectives;
Using the module 2 Poem Parser;
! implement a graphical user interface using JavaFX
- interface can be simplistic
- interface requires some level of user interaction
- live free with no other instruction

*** 
The files required to run the program are; 
    PoemParseFX.java,
    PoemParse_Sorter.java,
    ParseController.java,
    PoemParseGUI.fxml

PoemParseFX.java is the file that needs to 
be run for the application to execute. 
--It contains the main class-- 
***

Use case:
* Application Run
    User inputs file path of a .txt file containing
    a poem, or series of strings into the TextField
    at center screen, above "Submit" button.
    User clicks "Submit" button
* Exectution Output
    The individual strings and their frequency of
    occurence are printed to the TextArea, line by line,
    in order of greatest frequency to least.
    !format: "string = frequency"
* User Closes Program Window 

Challenges - post completion:
! Not enough resources for learning
    could have been helpful to have a sample GUI 
    or expected output in a UI
! The simplistic nature of the assignment was a point of stress
    Having more specific requirements could help reign in the 
    worry that the open endedness can cause, however,
    having the freedom to do anything is also helpful.
    Food for thought.
