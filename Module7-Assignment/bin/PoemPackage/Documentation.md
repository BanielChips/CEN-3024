Assignments:
Module 2 - Poem Sorter
Module 6 - JavaFX GUI for Module 2 program
Module 7 - Software Testing Using JavaFX

Program: PoemParse_Sorter
Current Version: 3

Objectives;
Using the module 2 Poem Parser;
! implement a graphical user interface using JavaFX
- interface can be simplistic
- interface requires some level of user interaction
- live free with no other instruction

*** 
The files required to run the program are; 
    PoemParseFX.java,
    PoemParse_Sorter.java,
    ParseController.java,
    PoemParseGUI.fxml

PoemParseFX.java is the file that needs to 
be run for the application to execute. 
--It contains the main class-- 
***

Version history:
1 - Module 2 Assignment
    Basic source code. Reads in a file and outputs 
    the strings and their frequencies of occurence.

2 - Module 6 Assignment
    Implemented JavaFX GUI. Input reads from a specified file path
    inputted by the user at the GUI. 
    Outputs words and their frequencies of occurrence to the GUI.

3 - Module 7 Assignment
    Implementing software testing capabilities using JUnit.
    Testing individual components in the Sorter class to ensure 
    their reliability.

Use cases:
    Version 2 Use Case;
    * Application Run
        User inputs file path of a .txt file containing
        a poem, or series of strings into the TextField
        at center screen, above "Submit" button.
        User clicks "Submit" button
    * Exectution Output
        The individual strings and their frequency of
        occurence are printed to the TextArea, line by line,
        in order of greatest frequency to least.
        !format: "string = frequency"
    * User Closes Program Window

Challenges - post completion - v2:
! Not enough resources for learning
    could have been helpful to have a sample GUI 
    or expected output in a UI
! The simplistic nature of the assignment was a point of stress
    Having more specific requirements could help reign in the 
    worry that the open endedness can cause, however,
    having the freedom to do anything is also helpful.
    Food for thought.
